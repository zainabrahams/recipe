Testing HTML skills by building a basic recipe website

To create this website, I used a range of HTML skills, including basic HTML structure with the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<a>` were incorporated to organize content, while `<img>` tags were used to display recipe images with proper `src` and `alt` attributes for accessibility. `<meta>` tags in the `<head>` were included to optimize the site for search engines, ensure proper character encoding, and improve mobile responsiveness. Additionally, the `target="_blank"` attribute was used for opening links in new tabs, with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` added for security and performance improvements when linking to external websites.
