    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>

    <p> Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering pasta sheets with a hearty filling, often consisting of a rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and a blend of cheeses. To make the meat sauce, ground beef and Italian sausage are typically sautéed with onions and garlic, then simmered with tomatoes, herbs, and a splash of red wine until it reaches a deep, flavorful consistency. Meanwhile, the béchamel sauce is created by whisking together butter, flour, and milk until smooth and velvety. A combination of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses is then prepared to bring creamy texture and a hint of sharpness to each layer.</p>

    <p>Assembling the lasagna starts with spreading a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of pasta sheets, a layer of meat sauce, dollops of béchamel, and a sprinkling of cheese. This process is repeated until all ingredients are used, finishing with a generous topping of cheese on the final layer. The lasagna is then baked in the oven until the top is golden and bubbling, and the layers have melded together perfectly. After baking, it’s best to let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before cutting to allow the layers to set, ensuring each slice has the perfect balance of flavors and textures. Serve it with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad for a comforting, satisfying meal.</p>
