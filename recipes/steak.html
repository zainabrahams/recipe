    <p>Steak is a timeless dish that highlights the natural flavor of high-quality beef, often cooked to perfection with a crispy, flavorful crust and a tender, juicy interior. Whether you prefer it rare, medium, or well-done, the key to a great steak is selecting the right cut of meat, seasoning it well, and cooking it with precision. Popular cuts include ribeye, filet mignon, and New York strip, each offering a unique balance of tenderness and marbling.</p>

    <p>To prepare steak, the meat is typically seasoned with salt, pepper, and sometimes garlic or herbs, before being seared in a hot pan or grilled to your desired level of doneness. Many steak lovers add a finishing touch, such as a pat of herb-infused butter, to enhance the flavor. Itâ€™s often served with sides like mashed potatoes, grilled vegetables, or a fresh salad, making it a satisfying and versatile meal perfect for any occasion.</p>
