    <p> Butter chicken, or <em>Murgh Makhani</em>, is a classic Indian dish known for its rich, creamy, and mildly spiced tomato-based sauce. The dish begins by marinating bite-sized chicken pieces in yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, and a blend of aromatic spices, which infuse the meat with layers of flavor while tenderizing it. After marinating, the chicken is seared to perfection, giving it a slight char and locking in the spices. This preparation enhances the dishâ€™s complex flavor profile, making each bite incredibly satisfying.</p>

    <p>The sauce, a defining element of butter chicken, is created by cooking onions, garlic, and ginger with tomato puree, garam masala, and other spices, then simmering until thick and flavorful. Heavy cream is added to the sauce at the end, giving it a luxurious, silky texture and balancing the spices with a mild sweetness. The finished dish is served hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, and pairs beautifully with naan or basmati rice, making it a comforting meal beloved in Indian cuisine and around the world for its rich, savory, and well-rounded flavors.</p>
